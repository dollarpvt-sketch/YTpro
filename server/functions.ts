/**
 * =================================================================================================
 * HEY THERE! THIS IS YOUR FIRST BACKEND FILE.
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * This file represents a serverless function, like one you would deploy to Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run.
 * It's written in TypeScript and shows the logic that should run on a server, NOT in the user's browser.
 *
 * WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
 * 1.  SECURITY: Your `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` is a secret. This code runs on your server,
 *     so the key is never exposed to the public.
 * 2.  POWER: The backend can perform heavy tasks and use powerful libraries that are not
 *     suitable for the frontend.
 *
 * TO MAKE THIS REAL:
 * 1.  You would create a new project for your backend (e.g., a Node.js project).
 * 2.  You would add this code to it.
 * 3.  You would install the necessary Google Cloud library: `npm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech`
 * 4.  You would deploy this function to Google Cloud.
 * 5.  The frontend would then call the URL of your deployed function.
 *
 * For now, we will simulate this interaction.
 */

// In a real backend, you would import the client library
// import { TextToSpeechClient } from '@google-cloud/text-to-speech';

/**
 * Simulates the backend function that generates audio from text.
 *
 * @param text The text to convert to speech.
 * @param voice The voice configuration.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with a base64 encoded audio string.

export const generateAudioFromText = async (text: string, voice: string, languageCode: string): Promise<string> => {
  console.log('[BACKEND SIMULATION] Received request to generate audio.');
  console.log(`[BACKEND SIMULATION] Text: "${text.substring(0, 50)}..."`);
  console.log(`[BACKEND SIMULATION] Voice: ${voice}`);

  // ========================== REAL BACKEND LOGIC WOULD GO HERE ==========================
  /*
  // 1. Initialize the Text-to-Speech client.
  //    The API key would be configured in your secure cloud environment (e.g., as an environment variable).
  const client = new TextToSpeechClient();

  // 2. Construct the request payload.
  const request = {
    input: { text: text },
    voice: { languageCode: languageCode, name: voice },
    audioConfig: { audioEncoding: 'MP3' },
  };

  // 3. Call the Google Cloud TTS API.
  const [response] = await client.synthesizeSpeech(request);
  
  // 4. Get the audio content and convert it to a base64 string to send back to the frontend.
  const audioContent = response.audioContent;
  if (!audioContent) {
      throw new Error('Failed to generate audio content.');
  }
  const base64Audio = Buffer.from(audioContent).toString('base64');

  // For now, we will return a mocked response to simulate the process.
  // This is a short, silent MP3 file encoded in base64.
  // In a real scenario, the base64 string from the API call above would be returned.
