/**
 * =================================================================================================
 * HEY THERE! THIS IS YOUR FIRST BACKEND FILE.
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * This file represents a serverless function, like one you would deploy to Google Cloud Functions or Cloud Run.
 * It's written in TypeScript and shows the logic that should run on a server, NOT in the user's browser.
 *
 * WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
 * 1.  SECURITY: Your `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` is a secret. This code runs on your server,
 *     so the key is never exposed to the public.
 * 2.  POWER: The backend can perform heavy tasks and use powerful libraries that are not
 *     suitable for the frontend.
 *
 * TO MAKE THIS REAL:
 * 1.  You would create a new project for your backend (e.g., a Node.js project).
 * 2.  You would add this code to it.
 * 3.  You would install the necessary Google Cloud library: `npm install @google-cloud/text-to-speech`
 * 4.  You would deploy this function to Google Cloud.
 * 5.  The frontend would then call the URL of your deployed function.
 *
 * For now, we will simulate this interaction.

// This file is currently empty because all operations are being handled on the client-side.
// If you needed to, for example, call a secure Google Cloud API with a secret key,
// you would add that function here.

// Example:
/*
export const performSecureAction = async (someData: any) => {
    // This is where you would use your secret API keys
    // const result = await someApi.doSomething(someData, { apiKey: process.env.MY_SECRET_KEY });
    // return result;
}
*/
